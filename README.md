# FLAproject
This is a simple lexical analyzer developed for the course: Formal Languages Languages and Automata Theory.
The project demonstrates the ability to define and implement a tokenizer capable of identifying valid tokens in a given input string or file,
based on a simple grammar and regular expressions.

*keep in mind: the comments describing various parts of the code are written in italian. For now, at least I won't change them*

## Features
- identifies keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators and punctuation
- written in Java
- processes input from test files with the formal .lft (stands for "linguaggi formali e traduttori", meaning "formal languages and traslators")
- some test files may require user input
- the lexer and parser output the list of recognised tokens with their type, based on an ASCII like table
- the translator5_1 (final part of the project) also generates the bytecode for the contents of the test file
